Introduction to Erbil and Its Citadel
Erbil, also spelled Hewlêr, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, located in the Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq. With a history stretching back over 6,000 years, Erbil has been a crossroads of ancient civilizations including the Sumerians, Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians. Today, it is a thriving modern city and a key cultural and economic hub in the region.
<hr>
At the heart of Erbil lies its most iconic landmark — the Erbil Citadel. Perched on a large, oval-shaped hill rising about 30 meters above the surrounding city, the Citadel is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a symbol of the city's deep historical roots. Archaeological evidence shows that the Citadel has been inhabited since at least the 5th millennium BCE, making it one of the longest continuously occupied sites in the world.</h4>
<h4><img class="rotatable" src="2.jpeg" alt="Empire square"><br>
Empire Square is one of the most prominent and modern landmarks in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Located in a bustling and rapidly developing area of the city, Empire Square is part of the Empire World project, a large-scale commercial and residential development that reflects Erbil’s transformation into a modern urban center.</h4>
<h4><img class="rotatable" src="3.jpeg" alt="Divan hotel"><br>
Located in the heart of Erbil’s modern business district near Empire Square, Divan Erbil is a premier 5-star hotel in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Renowned for its elegant design, top-tier security, and world-class hospitality, it is the preferred destination for global leaders, international delegations, and high-profile business travelers.
<hr>
Built by the Turkish Divan Group, the property features 228 luxury rooms and suites, multiple restaurants, indoor pool, and extensive meeting facilities—making it a standout “business hotel” in Iraq, honored six years in a row.</h4>
